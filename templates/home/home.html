                            <P>We've all witnessed the hype around ChatGPT since OpenAI released it to the public.

                            <p>Chances are you're one of its 100 million users—I know I am. I've used the AI chatbot to
                                generate content ideas for articles, write emails I'd rather not write, and get Google
                                Sheets formulas I can't figure out on my own. (Which is often.) </p>


                            While I've perfected the art of writing prompts to get the best result, I am painfully aware
                            of ChatGPT's limitations: for example, in order to access the more powerful GPT-4 and its
                            suite of plugins, you have to pay for ChatGPT Plus, and there's no longer a web browser you
                            can tap into.
                            </P>
                            <p>
                                This is a key difference that Bard, Google's answer to ChatGPT, definitely scores points
                                with—it offers a lot of what ChatGPT does, faster and for free.

                                Since the release of Bard, I've been using both tools; one as a research tool, the other
                                as a writing assistant. But there are plenty of other differences that set them
                                apart—and which will dictate how you use each tool. Let's dive in.
                            </p>

                            <h3>ChatGPT vs. Google Bard at a glance</h3>
                            <p>At a base level, both chatbots use natural language processing, which means users key in
                                a prompt or query, and the chatbots generate a human-like response.

                                There are a few key differences, though, that boil down to the data sources and models
                                they've been trained on.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Google Bard uses Google's Pathways Language Model (PaLM 2) and can offer responses
                                    based on real-time, current events pulled from Google Search—making for a great
                                    research tool.</li>
                                <li>ChatGPT, on the other hand, uses its Generative Pre-training Transformer 3 (GPT-3),
                                    or GPT-4 for paid subscribers, with data sources up to 2021, so it makes for a
                                    better text generator or writing tool.</li>
                                <li> Both Bard and ChatGPT will run into logic issues. For example, I asked them both
                                    the same simple logic question, and they both got it wrong.</li>
                            </ul>

            <p>More and more public sector organizations are turning to the cloud to improve their efficiency,
                resilience, and overall security stance. But to take full advantage of cloud computing in your agency,
                you need more than a lift-and-shift approach to your migration. You need cloud workers and a public
                sector cloud strategy to overcome challenges and drive your mission forward</p>
            <blockquote>

            <h4 class="blog-post-title mb-3">1. Security and compliance requirements</h4>
            <p>Whether it’s HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIST, FedRAMP, or something else, security and compliance isn’t anything new
                for public sector organizations. No matter how familiar you are with various compliance frameworks,
                shifting to the cloud means navigating new regulations while ensuring security standards.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="blog-post-title mb-3">2. Lack of cloud workers</h4>
            <p>Historically, the public sector has struggled to compete with the private sector for tech talent. And
                that hasn’t changed.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Even as more tech talent enters the market (due to layoffs in the tech industry), government agencies
                    struggle to recruit and retain cloud engineers. Why? Complex hiring processes, less competitive
                    benefits, and lack of flexibility often top the list.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>But legacy technology systems also present a substantial barrier. Many cloud workers want to stay on
                    the cutting edge and lack the skills or desire to work with the legacy systems that pervade public
                    sector organizations.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <h4 class="blog-post-title mb-3">3. Acquiring cloud services that meet public sector contract requirements
            </h4>
            <p>Cloud computing services use a pay-as-you-go pricing model. This lets agencies scale their cloud services
                up or down to meet their current needs.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Public sector organizations can use indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts to
                    invest in metered services like cloud computing. However, these contracts are often time-consuming
                    and costly to set up.</p>
                <p>Even if you’re able to navigate IDIQ contracts, your agency may face scrutiny about which cloud
                    service providers you offer those contracts to.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <h4 class="blog-post-title mb-3">4. Legacy infrastructure spending</h4>
            <p>Public sector organizations, including the federal government, continue to prioritize legacy, on-premises
                systems despite the push to the cloud.

                In fact, even though 54% of public sector CIOs said they’d increase cloud spend at the beginning of
                2022, only 35% said they’d decrease spending on legacy infrastructure and data center technologies. As
                long as agencies continue to prioritize legacy systems, they won’t see full cloud transformation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <h2>Cloud computing opportunities for public sector</h2>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Despite the challenges, cloud computing still offers opportunities for public sector organizations to
                    enhance their operations. If your agency can think beyond the technology itself to the people and
                    processes that will manage it, you’ll see cloud success.</p>
                <p>Cloud service providers use a shared responsibility model that defines which infrastructure
                    responsibilities they own and which they leave to individual organizations.

                    These models can help you allocate resources more effectively. For example, if you aren’t
                    responsible for managing the cloud’s software or hardware, you can dedicate more technologists to
                    critical areas like cybersecurity.

                    Just make sure you fully understand the shared responsibility model and what you and your cloud
                    workers are responsible for</p>

                        massive opportunity. </P>
                    <P>Compliance frameworks help government agencies ensure their environments comply with the latest
                        restrictions and regulations. In the case of the cloud, you can look at a cloud provider’s
                        compliance documentation to determine if their services are authorized under a certain
                        framework. If they are, you know their services have been vetted and comply with critical
                        requirements.</P>
                    <P>Check potential cloud providers for compliance with frameworks such as:</P>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The traditional authorization process for new systems follows a series of linear steps: Public
                        sector organizations will develop a system and assess its security. They’ll authorize it. Then
                        they’ll use it.</p>
                    <p>While this method provides an extensive assessment of a system’s vulnerabilities, it’s also
                        time-consuming. By the time the authorization is complete, the system may already be out of date
                    </p>
                    <p>Continuous Authority to Operate (cATO) provides a more nimble approach. cATO continuously
                        authorizes underlying cloud infrastructure, systems, and platforms. This enables agencies to
                        focus on capability and code delivery, rather than constantly building and authorizing new
                        platforms and infrastructure.</p>
